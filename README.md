With a stream reader, you can read the data in the specified format while downloading, which makes the user experience better. You don't have to do the chunk slicing and buffering yourself, the reader does all that.

Without it, you would have to wait for all the data to be downloaded before you could read it (e.g., via DataView). Since JS doesn't support structures, you have to pass in an offset parameter for each read, which is inconvenient to use.


# Why Quick

We used two tricks to improve performance:

* selective await

* synchronized EOF

## selective await

The overhead of await is considerable, here is a test:

```js
let s1 = 0, s2 = 0

console.time('no-await')
for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i++) {
  s1 += i
}
console.timeEnd('no-await')   // ~15ms

console.time('await')
for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i++) {
  s2 += await i
}
console.timeEnd('await')      // Chrome: ~800ms, Safari: ~3000ms
```

https://jsbin.com/gehazin/edit?html,output

The above two cases do the same thing, but the await one is 50x to 200x slower than the no-await. On Chrome it's even ~2000x slower if the console is open (only ~500 await/ms).

This test seems meaningless, but in fact, sometimes we call await heavily in an almost synchronous logic, such as an async query function that will mostly hit the memory cache and return.

```js
async function query(key) {
  if (cacheMap.has(key)) {
    return ...  // 99.9%
  }
  await ...
}
```

Reading data from a stream has the same issue. For a single integer or tiny text, it takes only a few bytes, in most cases, it can be read directly from the buffer without I/O calls, so await is unnecessary; await is only needed when the buffer is not enough.

If await is called only when needed, the overhead can be reduced many times.

```js
console.time('selective-await')
for (let i = 0; i < 1e7; i++) {
  const value = (i % 1000)  // buffer enough?
    ? i         // 99.9%
    : await i   //  0.1%
}
console.timeEnd('selective-await')  // ~40ms üöÄ
```

For `QuickReader`, when its buffer is enough, it returns the result immediately; otherwise, it returns nothing (`undefined`), and the result can be obtained by `await A`.

```js
function readBytes(len) {
  if (len < availableLen) {
    return buf.subarray(offset, offset + len)   // likely
  }
  A = readBytesAsync(len)
}

async function readBytesAsync(len) {
  await stream.read()
  ...
}
```

The calling logic can be simplified into one line using the [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator):

```js
result = readBytes(10) ?? await A
```

This is both high-performance and easy-to-use. 

> Note: The `A` is not a global variable in the real code, it's just an imported object that implements [thenable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#thenable_objects), you can rename it on import.

## synchronized EOF

`QuickReader` always keeps its buffer at least 1 byte, this means when the available buffer length is 4 and call `reader.u32()`, the result will not be returned immediately, but requires await. The buffer will not be fully read until the stream is closed.

In this way, the EOF state can be detected synchronously, nearly zero overhead.


# Node.js

NodeStream is also supported:

```js
const stream = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/file')
const reader = new QuickReader(stream)
// ...
```

More broadly, any `AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>` can be passed as a stream.

> NodeStream has implemented [AsyncIterable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#readablesymbolasynciterator) and the [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) is a subclass of Uint8Array.


# API

## By length

* bytes(len: `number`) : `Uint8Array`

* skip(len: `number`) : `number`

* txtNum(len: `number`) : `string`

## By delimiter

* bytesTo(delim: `number`) : `Uint8Array`

* skipTo(delim: `number`) : `number`

* txtTo(delim: `number`) : `string`

## Helper

* txt() : `string` - Equivalent to `txtTo(0)`.

* txtLn() : `string` - Equivalent to `txtTo(10)`.

## Numbers

* {u, i}{8, 16, 32, 16be, 32be}() : `number`

* {u, i}{64, 64be}() : `bigint`

* f{32, 64, 32be, 64be}() : `number`

# Usage Rules

The `?? await A` must be executed immediately after each reading, otherwise something will go wrong. 

It is better to use TypeScript. When you forget to add `?? await A`, the type of result will be unioned with `undefined`, which makes it easier to expose the issue.

```js
const id = reader.u32()   // number | undefined
id.toString()             // ‚ùå
```

Since the `A` is consumed immediately after it is generated, even if there are multiple `QuickReader` instances, they will not conflict with each other.


# Concurrency

The same reader is not allowed to be called by multiple co-routines in parallel, as this would break the waiting order. Therefore, the following logic should not be used:

```js
reader = new QuickReader(stream)

async function routine() {
  do {
    const id = reader.u32() ?? await A
    const name = reader.txt() ?? await A
    // ...
  } while (!reader.eof)
}
// ‚ùå
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  routine()
}
```


# Read Line

`QuickReader` can also be used for line-by-line reading. It reduces the overhead by ~60% compared to the Node.js' native `readline` module, because its parsing logic is simpler, e.g. using only `\n` delimiter (ignoring `\r`).

```js
const stream = fs.createReadStream('log.txt')
const reader = new QuickReader(stream)

// no error if the file does not end with '\n'
reader.eofAsDelim = true

do {
  const line = reader.txtLn() ?? await A
  // ...
} while (!reader.eof)
```

Of course, as mentioned above, concurrency is not supported. If there are multiple co-routines reading the same file, it is better to use the native `readline` module:

```js
import * as fs from 'node:fs'
import * as readline from 'node:readline'

const stream = fs.createReadStream('urls.txt')
const rl = readline.createInterface({input: stream})
const iter = rl[Symbol.asyncIterator]()

async function routine() {
  for (;;) {
    const {value: url} = await iter.next()
    if (!url) { 
      break
    }
    const res = await fetch(url)
    // ...
  }
}

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  routine()
}
```


# About

The idea of this project was born when the `await` keyword was introduced. The earliest solution was:

```js
const result = reader.read() || await A
```

Since the `||` operator will also short-circuit `0` and `''`, so it was not perfect, until the `??` was introduced in ES2020.

However, the performance of await had been greatly improved compared to the past, so it was not as meaningful as it was then. Anyway, I still share this idea, even if it is 2022 now, after all, performance optimization is never-ending.

Due to limited time and English, the document and some code comments (e.g. index.d.ts) were translated via Google, hopefully someone will improve it.
